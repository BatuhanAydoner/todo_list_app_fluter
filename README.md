## My Goal
The objective of this project is to understand how to manage state in Flutter. I looked at various Flutter architecture choices and learn to use the officially recommended Provider package to manage our app state.

## What I Created
A todolist app to keep track of all your tasks.

## What I Learned
* Understand what is state and why we need to manage it.
* Understand the difference between ephemeral (local) state and app state.
* See the problems with simply relying on setState().
* Learn about the concept of Prop Drilling.
* Examine various popular ways of managing app state for Flutter projects.
* Learn about the List Builder.
* Use the Flutter BottomSheet Widget.
* Learn to lift state up to be able to access it from children widgets.
* Learn about design patterns and why they are useful.
* Understand how the Provider package works and use it to manage app state.
